I am a software developer in training at Makers Academy, one of the best coding bootcamps in Europe. 

After my first degree in economics, I gained practical experience working in administrative and accounting roles until I finally took the leap to follow my dream of becoming a software developer. 

I then successfully secured my first role as a software developer at  Starling Bank, which I resume at the end of my training at Makers Academy.
I am eager to adopt the best practices and to continue improving my skills as a developer while working in a supportive and dynamic environment.

## Skills

#### Quick Learner 

Since I started on my coding Journey, I have always been quickly pick up new technologies.
From my first ever coding workshop with [rails girls london](http://railsgirls.london/), I went on to complete a coding course with Code First Girls and I worked on a project with my teammates: [A static Website](https://rhiannakemi.github.io/).

I then took part in a one month React course while also learning Javascript with different projects to show at the end of the course: [A todo list app in React](https://github.com/funmia/todo-react), [A weather app in Javascript](http://warm-shelf-55173.herokuapp.com/).

I also attended a one-day React Native course at CodeBar and worked a Snapchat app clone: https://github.com/funmia/snap-app-react-native

#### Growth Mindset

My adoption of a growth mindset has also been key to improving my skills as a developer. I believe that I am able to increase my technical, and problem-solving skills overtime through hard work, determination and perseverance. 
I have been commended by my mentors on my determination, as I have always sought out to achieve my goals. 

#### Web Development

Before Makers, I always sought out learning opportunities and ways to improve my technical skills. I enjoyed attending hackathons as an accelerated way of learning about new technologies, to build interesting projects and to collaborate with other people.

- I participated in an Accessible Tech in Employment hackathon on a team of four where I worked on the Front-end of the project and my team won the award for the most practical solution to help blind and visually impaired people: https://github.com/funmia/teambeaconwebsite 
 
- I also took part in Starling Bank's first open API hackathon. I worked with my team on building a chatbot that provides insights about Starling bank user account: https://github.com/funmia/starling-hackathon 


#### Attention to Detail 

My experience working in Administrative and accounting roles means I am able to pay close attention to fine details and easily spot discrepancies in my work. This comes in handy when writing code, debugging.
